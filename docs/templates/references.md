### Autoencoders:

Nice set of [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPz3MPl5jvY&list=PLyqSpQzTE6M9gCgajvQbc68Hk_JKGBAYT&index=52)
from NPTEL which describe how Auto-enocders work in detail.

### Crpytography:

You can have a look at [Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto) from Stanford University.
