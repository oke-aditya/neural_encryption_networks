# ICADCML 2021 A Novel Approach to Encrypt Data using Deep Neural Networks

This is docs built using [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).
## Project layout

This is how the project is structured.
We also provide Colab Notebooks that can be used to reproduce our results.

```

├── docs                            # Documentation files built using mkdocs
├── models                          # Models that we trained
├── neural_encryption_networks      # This folder contains all code.
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── notebooks                   # Reproducible notebooks.
│   └── src                         # Python scripts.
└── requirements.txt                # To install stuff.
