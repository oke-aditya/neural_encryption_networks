## How to use this: -

- Choose use this repo as template option in GitHub.
- This should create a repo in your GitHub account.

## Files to edit to set up your project.

- You would need to edit some files in order to rename this from `py_fresh` to your required repo name.
- Just replace `pip install git+git://github.com/oke-aditya/py_fresh.git` in the `mk-docs-build.yml` and `mk-docs-deploy.yml` workflows in .github folder with your package git url. This will set up docs.
- You may need to edit the CI, installation and deployment yml files in .github folder. They need minimal editing for new project.
- Please edit **ALL** the `.md` files to include description that you need.
- Edit the `.gitingore` and `.dockerignore` files if anything extra is needed. I have included most stuff in them.
- Edit the `settings.ini` and ` setup.py` . You perhaps need your name and different requirements. Again most stuff is there you need very small tweaks.
- Edit the `requirements.txt` and `requirements-extra.txt` (optionally).
- Edit the `LICENSE` you may need a different one.
- Do edit the docs folder. It is built using [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org). You can refer to mkdocs to know more how to edit docs. This is just minimalistic docs which does the job.
- Optionally Add tests to `tests` folder using `pytest`.

Also please read the `README` files that are present in the folders. They will help and guide you to setup stuff too.
