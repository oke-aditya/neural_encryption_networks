In this paper we propose a novel approach to Encrpyt data using Deep Neural Networks.
We propose an Autoencoder techinque which can sucessfully encrypt and decrypt data.
We secure this method using keys by ensembling autoencoders.

## Project layout

This is how the project is structured.
We also provide Colab Notebooks that can be used to reproduce our results.
