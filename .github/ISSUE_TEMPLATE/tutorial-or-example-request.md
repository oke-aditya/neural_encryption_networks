## ðŸ““ New <Tutorial/Example>

**Is this a request for a tutorial or for an example?**
Tutorials are in `.ipynb` format, explaining each step of the process, really detailed, not production like.

Examples are be in the `.py` format, more production oriented. Ready to be run with arguments from the command line and easy to integrate with wandb sweeps and alike.
